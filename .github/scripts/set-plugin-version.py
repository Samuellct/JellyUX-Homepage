#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Called by semantic-release prepareCmd, before `jprm plugin build`. Patches the compiled assembly's
own AssemblyVersion/FileVersion/Version to match the release version.

Without this, the .csproj's hardcoded "0.1.0.0" ships in every release's DLL regardless of the
actual plugin version (manifest.json / build.yaml / the release tag all update correctly via jprm,
but the compiled assembly itself never did). TransformationPatches.IndexHtml reads
Plugin.Instance.Version -- which .NET resolves to this exact AssemblyVersion -- to build the
`?v=...` cache-busting query string on every injected <script>/<link> tag. Since that version never
changed, every release's JS/CSS was served from browser cache indefinitely (up to the
`Cache-Control: max-age=3600` response header) after an update, hard refresh or not depending on
timing -- confirmed live on jellyux-test (TODO_V3.md Phase 7 manual testing) as the root cause of
several "the fix isn't working" reports that were actually stale cached JS.

Usage: python3 .github/scripts/set-plugin-version.py <semver>  (e.g. "2.5.3")
