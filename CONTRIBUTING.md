# Contributing to JellyUX Homepage

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document covers the development setup, conventions, and workflow.

---

## Development Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) (x64)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Git

---

## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samuellct/JellyUX-Homepage.git
   cd JellyUX-Homepage
   ```

2. Start the test Jellyfin server:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```
   Copy `docker/.env.example` to `docker/.env` and adjust the media paths before the first run.

3. Build and deploy the plugin to the test container (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   .\docker\scripts\deploy-plugin.ps1
   ```
   This builds the plugin, copies the DLL to the container's plugin directory, and restarts Jellyfin.

4. Open `http://localhost:8096` to verify the plugin is loaded.

## Code Conventions

- **Language**: All code, variable names, comments, commit messages, and documentation must be written in **English**.
- **Commits**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`
  - One atomic commit per logical change
  - Example: `feat: add ContinueWatching widget`
- **No commented-out code**: Dead code must be deleted, not commented.
- **CSS prefix**: All plugin CSS classes must use the `jux-` prefix.
- **CSS variables**: Reuse native Jellyfin CSS variables (`var(--primaryTextColor)`, `var(--accent)`, etc.) instead of hardcoding colors.

## Design Rules - No AI Slope

The following design elements are **strictly forbidden** in any contributed code, markup, or assets:

### Banned fonts

Inter, Poppins, Manrope, Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans, Space Grotesk

### Banned colors and patterns

- Blue-violet or violet-cyan gradients
- Tailwind Blue `#3B82F6`
- Background Gray-50 `#F9FAFB`
- Black + neon violet combination
- Turquoise accent on dark background

### Typography

- No em dashes (the long dash character). Use regular hyphens or restructure the sentence.

---

## Adding a Widget

1. Create a class implementing `IWidget` in `src/Jellyfin.Plugin.JuxHomepage/Widgets/`.
2. Register it in `PluginServiceRegistrator.RegisterServices()`.
3. Add localization keys for both `fr.json` and `en.json` under `src/.../Localization/`.
4. Document the widget in the README widget table.

---

## Testing

**Automated tests** (once available):
```bash
dotnet test
```

**Manual test procedure**:
1. Run `.\docker\scripts\deploy-plugin.ps1` to deploy the latest build.
2. Open `http://localhost:8096` and verify the home screen loads correctly.
3. Check the browser console for errors.
4. Test widget configuration from the admin panel.

---

## Jellyfin Update Test Procedure

1. Bump the `jellyfin/jellyfin` image in `docker/docker-compose.yml`, then run `docker compose -f
   docker/docker-compose.yml up -d`.
2. Follow the "Jellyfin Update Procedure" in `CLAUDE.md` to confirm the `loadSections` chunk is still
   detected and patched.
3. Reload the home page: if the JellyUX sections do not render, check the browser console (prefix
   `[JellyUX]`) before suspecting the minified hook constants.
4. Re-run at least the Phase 12 manual tests (multi-client compatibility + robustness).

## Submitting a Contribution

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes following the conventions above.
3. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of what changed and why.
4. Ensure the CI build passes before requesting review.

Note: this repository uses `main` as the only permanent branch. Feature branches exist only in forks.
