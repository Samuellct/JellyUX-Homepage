# Seasonal

**Category:** Connected

Displays items from your local library during a recurring, admin-configured date window (e.g.
Halloween, Christmas), optionally restricted to a specific genre and/or tag. Unlike the other
Connected widgets, Seasonal does not depend on any external data source (no TMDb or Wikidata call, no
API key needed) -- it is classified as Connected rather than Admin so it gets a fully custom editor in
the admin panel instead of the generic single-value picker every Admin widget shares.

The plugin ships with four disabled-by-default presets (Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, New
Year); enable the ones you want, or add your own custom Seasonal section with any date window, theme,
and optional genre/tag filter.

A section outside its configured date window returns no items and is automatically hidden from the
home screen, the same generic "not enough items" behavior every widget already relies on -- there is
no separate "hide when out of season" setting to configure.

## Parameters

In addition to the [common parameters](../../configuration.md#common-per-widget-parameters):

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Theme | An optional visual theme (`Halloween`, `Christmas`, `Valentine's Day`, `New Year`, or none). Currently only `Christmas` adds a visual effect (a snow overlay on the section); the others are purely labels for your own organization. |
| Start date / End date | The recurring `MM-DD` window during which this section is shown (e.g. `10-01` to `10-31` for Halloween). A window whose end date is earlier than its start date is treated as wrapping across the new year (e.g. `12-26` to `01-06`). |
| Genre (optional) | Restricts the section to one genre present in your library. Leave empty to include every genre. |
| Tag (optional) | Restricts the section to one tag present in your library. Leave empty to include every tag. |

## Presets

| Preset | Default window | Default theme |
|---|---|---|
| Halloween | October 1 - October 31 | Halloween |
| Christmas | December 1 - December 25 | Christmas |
| Valentine's Day | February 7 - February 14 | Valentine's Day |
| New Year | December 26 - January 6 | New Year |

Each preset ships disabled and with no genre/tag filter (a pre-filled genre like "Horror" could easily
match nothing in your library, since genre taxonomies vary) -- enable the ones you want and adjust the
dates or add a filter to fit your own library and timezone.
